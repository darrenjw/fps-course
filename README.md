## Category theory for pure functional programming in Scala - materials for course participants

Materials for registered participants of the course "Category theory for pure functional programming in Scala". The course notes are not publicly available.

**I occasionally run this course as in-house training for Scala developer teams (ideally northern England/southern Scotland). [Email me](mailto:darrenjwilkinson@btinternet.com) if you are interested in this. Also note that I run an introductory course on [Scala for Statistical Computing and Data Science](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course).**

* [Course outline](Outline.md)
* [Fragments](fragments/) - code blocks extracted from the course notes
* [sbt project template](app-template/) - SBT project template including a dependencies on all of the libraries used in the course, to be copied and edited to create new projects. But if you have an internet connection, just doing `sbt new darrenjw/fps.g8` is easier and better.
* [Examples](examples/) - some examples
* [Exercises](exercises/Readme.md) - some exercises
* [Links](Links.md) - some links to additional on-line resources
