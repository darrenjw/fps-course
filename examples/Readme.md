## Stand-alone Scala programs

This directory contains a few stand-alone Scala programs to illustrate some of the ideas discussed during the course.

* [Monocle](monocle/) - a simple optics demo
* [IO](io/) - a couple of different ways of running IO apps
* [MyList](mylist/) - a pure functional linked list from scratch, together with Cats instances, and a collection of unit, property-based and law tests
