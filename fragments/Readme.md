# Code fragments

## Fragments of code from the course notes, for pasting into a REPL

This directory contains all of the code fragments automatically extracted from the course notes. Each extracted code chunk is clearly labelled. The notes are written using [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/), so the chunks labelled `mdoc` should paste into the REPL one at a time and execute correctly. Chunks which are not labelled are not intended to be pasted into the REPL. Chunks labelled `reset` expect a restart of the REPL.
